Sass TextMate Bundle for TextMate
==================================
Forked from [https://github.com/seaofclouds/sass-textmate-bundle](https://github.com/seaofclouds/sass-textmate-bundle). 

I looked around for decent Sass bundles with better syntax highlighting, but I ended up modifying this godfather bundle.

Installation
------------

Put the sass-textmate-bundle.tmBundle file in `<username>/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles`.

The easiest way to install is just to clone from this repository:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    git clone git@github.com:nathos/sass-textmate-bundle.git sass-textmate-bundle.tmbundle

This way you can use the built-in updater (Bundles -> Sass -> Utilities -> Update Bundle) to pull in new changes.
