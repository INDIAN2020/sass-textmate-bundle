# Sass Textmate Bundle for Textmate

Forked from [https://github.com/seaofclouds/sass-textmate-bundle](https://github.com/seaofclouds/sass-textmate-bundle). I looked around for decent Sass bundles with better syntax highlighting, but I ended up modifying this godfather bundle.

# Installation

Put the sass-textmate-bundle.tmBundle file in `<username>/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles`.

Also check out my Textmate theme which goes well with this bundle: [Dyluni Textmate theme](https://github.com/johanbrook/dyluni-textmate-theme).
